# Dip League - Coding Challenge

This is a lean command line Python3 program (with no dependencies) used to rank teams in a league as explained in the attached PDF.

## Usage

### 1. Default mode

Run `main.py` using python 3 & it will read from default input file `inputs.txt` 
and writes the results to a default `outputs.txt`

You may replace the contents of `inputs.txt` as long as the format is adhered to.

### 2. Expert Mode

Run `main.py` using python 3 while supplying the command line arguments full input & output file paths respectively as below:

`python3 main.py <input_file_path.txt> <output_file_path.txt>`

Make sure the input file format is adhered to as outlined in the PDF attached.

### 3. Help Mode

For sample usage, run `main.py` using python 3 while supplying the command line argument **_--help_** as below:

`python3 main.py --help`
